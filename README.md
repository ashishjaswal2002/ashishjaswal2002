  Hey there, I'm Ashish Jaswal - a self-proclaimed coding ninja and coffee addict. I spend most of my days typing furiously on my keyboard, muttering to myself about missing semicolons and misplaced parentheses. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me binge-watching Netflix, playing video games, or trying to convince my cat to become a software engineer. Just kidding, I got no cat. Thanks for stopping by and joining me on this wild coding adventure!
